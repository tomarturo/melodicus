# Melodicus: Learn the licks and songs you love

This application allows you view any YouTube video in a custom player designed to optimize the experience of learning melodies, solos, and licks from your favorite songs. 

All of the controls in Melodicus exist in the standard YouTube player but they are hidden in submenus and laborious to use repeatedly.

The heart of Melodicus is a looping function enabling users (musicians, music teachers, students, etc) to isolate a specific part of a song and play it back indefinitely. 

I built this to address my use case of an iPad resting on a music stand and a guitar in my hands. I strove to make the tap targets large and easy to use on a touch screen. I hope others find it useful too.
